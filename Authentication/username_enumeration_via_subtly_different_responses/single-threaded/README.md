# Hack Steps
1. Obtain a valid username via subtly different error messages
2. Brute force password of that valid username

# Run Script
1. change the URL of the lab
2. change the PATH for your usernames list
3. change the PATH for you passwords list
4. Start script
```
~$ cargo run
```

# Expected Output
```
[#] Enumerate usernames..

# Test Samples
This test is done using only 100 users & 100 passwods. What about 10K users & 10K passwords?
Or what about 100K users & 100K passwords?

You can see the comparison I made with these numbers when solving the [Lab: Username enumeration via different responses](https://github.com/elqalawii/portswigger_labs_with_rust/tree/main/Authentication/username_enumeration_via_different_responses) to see the big difference in speed between Rust and Python and also between single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches in Rust.
